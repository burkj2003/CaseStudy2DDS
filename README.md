# Project-Two

My final project for DS-6306


The project will examine the data from 870 company employees to attempt to assist senior management in how 140 employees left.

I will ensure the data is cleaned and tidy before examining various aspects of why attrition reached 16.1%.

Various charts will be displayed as part of the .PPTX file that is included in this repository.

Future predictions will be made based on various models that have been used including knn, naive bayes and linear regression.

All files contained on this site will attempt to assist in determining the best path forward for senior management.

Thank you.
